## Am I the Baddie: A Stakeholder Reflective

The key takeaway I have from the cases we've read this semester can be summarized in a singular statement: **sometimes we are very bad at being good.**

The use of the inclusive "we" in that statement is intentional.  It is difficult for me to hold any condemnation over the actions of anybody in these cases, because I can't fully understand the pressures that each case protagonist went through.  Across every case we have read over the course of the last 4 months, I hope that I was not alone in reading every case - especially the ones that went especially wrong - and thinking: *"This could have been me."*

The most startling moments in these cases was reading about some disastrous action made by a case protagonist and knowing that probably would have done, or have done, something strikingly close to what they have done.  While my actions have (hopefully, to my knowledge) never resulted in deaths, addictions, job losses, or fraud, I can the rationales of many of these case protagonists reflected in my own thinking.

Learning about the pitfalls of these cases and reviewing the situations in retrospect has been a foil for how I need to change my own decision making in the future, lest I end up in a Harvard Business Review case study someday.

## Correction: Think Before Promising

**Overpromising is, in essence, premeditated fraud.**

I have nothing but sympathy for Elizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos and current chargee of multiple counts of federal fraud.

Elizabeth Holmes was told at *nineteen years old,* by *trusted advisors*, that she should take a hiatus from school and begin a company based on a foundation of technology that didn't exist. This was followed by years of overpromising to the same shareholders, some of whom invested under the impression that an individual who society did not yet trust to purchase Pabst Blue Ribbon from any bodega across the nation *wouldn't* make claims not fully based in reality. For that, she has my deepest condolences.

**It is difficult to know what is possible without first experiencing what isn't possible.** Being young is, by its' very nature, a near-equivalent to being inexperienced. Hand-in-hand with inexperience comes an approximate knowledge of what is and isn't in the realm of possibility. If you promise something impossible enough, it begins to creep up on the spectrum of fraud. 

This semester, I was the student leader for a group of 30 engineering students. Engineering students are, at their very core, unexciting individuals. If you have ever met an exciting engineer, that behavior was learned by study, not given as a birthright. We, like many groups, would be disciplined by the University if we held any form of COVID-unsafe planning. This is reasonable - in general, it is probably unwise to place the trust of self-moderation in anybody in their twenties.

Being an engineering group of little prior incident, however, I was sure I could petition the University to make a special case for us.
