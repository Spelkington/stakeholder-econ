# Handy: The Future of Work

## If you were in Hanrahan’s position, what’s your view of classifying cleaners on Handy’s platform? What are the economic and ethical implications? Do they conflict?

> [...] Society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic.

*- Karl Marx, The German Ideology*

In this case - and in the case of most gig economies - I agree with Hanrahan's notion that there ought to be a new economic classification for gig economy workers. The rise of online platforms is a fundamentally new approach to the business landscape. By incurring nearly all the fixed costs required to start what would normally be a "full" small business, the modern online platform tranfers the risks incurred from investing in significant overhead from skilled workers to the platform itself.

In the case of any specialist seeking the flexibility of owning their own business, here's what starting a full small business might entail:

1. Purchasing the equipment required for the specialist to do their task
2. In the modern world, creating a website (or other digital listing) and constantly managing this service;
3. Advertising to create a large and reliable customer base;
4. In the case of appointment-based specialists, setting up a working schedule to accommodate the interested customer base; and
5. Set up a system for collecting (and, if necessary, enforcing) payments.

A centralized platform can, ideally, handle points **2**, **3**, and **5** by leveraging the digital economies of scale - it is, overall, more cost-efficient for one platform run by dedicated developers to handle the digital logistics and advertising overhead for 100 specialists than it is for 100 individual specialists to create 100 websites of the same capabilities for themselves, both in terms of specific knowledge and digital infrastructure required.

A large enough platform can provide more flexibility to **4** by providing a broader selection of times and dates from which specialists can select from.

Ultimately, **digital platforms place the specialists it hosts under the same fixed-cost umbrella,** allowing for easier entry in (and out) of the labor market for constituents of that specialization.

At risk of sounding Marxian, then, it is important to note that by concentrating entry in and out of the market into the hands of a single platform, that platform will:

1. Void of regulation, have full control over the design of the market **and** who can or cannot participate in the market.
2. Be able to extract value from both the convenience created for the customer *and* the convenience created for the specialist.
